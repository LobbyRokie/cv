## üìÇ ACADEMIC PROJECTS 

#### [Multi-level Analysis with Random and Mixed Effects using R - Academic Success in Math](https://github.com/LobbyRokie/cv/blob/gh-pages/Academic%20Projects/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Multi-level%20Analysis%20with%20Random%20and%20Mixed%20Effects%20using%20R%20-%20Academic%20Success%20in%20Math.pdf) _(2015)_ 
* Methodology: <br>
  Created a linear mixed model that clustered the data into three levels (Regions, Schools, and Students) and used the step-up strategy to identify the school-level and student-level factors that contributed to academic success while testing random effects.

* Results: <br>
  The findings indicated that the relationship between students‚Äô mathematics achievement and socioeconomic status was not the same for the students‚Äô parents with different educational background; there were significant interactions between students‚Äô minority status and school-level covariates; the difference in math performance between public and private school was statistically insignificant.


#### [Logistic Regression & Decision Tree - Credit Risk and Interest Revenue Assessment using FICO Analytic Cloud](https://github.com/LobbyRokie/cv/blob/gh-pages/Academic%20Projects/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Logistic%20Regression%20and%20Decision%20Tree%20using%20FICO%20Analytic%20Cloud%20-%20Credit%20Risk%20and%20Interest%20Revenue%20Assessment.pdf) _(2015)_ <br>
* Developed HELOC Approval Model that improved the credit grantor‚Äôs current model‚Äôs LR^2 by 18.7% and ROC by 3%. The new Decision Tree Strategy rejected 35% more applicants who would have defaulted by only sacrificing 12% anticipated revenue for risk-averse creditor.



#### [Multiple Linear Regression and Predictive Data Modeling - Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/LobbyRokie/cv/blob/gh-pages/Academic%20Projects/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Predictive%20Data%20Modeling%20-%20Boston%20Housing%20Prices.pdf) _(2015)_ <br>
* Methodology: <br>
  1. Partitioned the data into training and validation sets with 60/40 ratio to avoid overfitting. <br>
  2. Reduced the number of predictors that have high correlation and low coefficient to avoid multicollinearity. <br>
  3. Chose the top three models by running on the training set and comparing Cp, Adjusted R^2, SSE, RMSE, Average Error, and lift chart. <br>

* Results: <br>
  The final best model yielded a SSE of 8170 and a RMSE of 5.18 on the training data and 3698 and 4.28 on the validation data. <br>

#### Statistical Analysis with Linear Regression Model - Treatment Effects on Plasma Epinephrine (PE) Concentration using R _(2015)_ <br>
* Methodology: <br>
  1. Compared the means and variances for two factors using classical effects ANOVA model for Anesthesias and Dogs. <br>
  2. Conducted pairwise multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction based on the results from part (a). <br>
  3. Checked distributional assumption for the data set using Residuals vs. Fitted, Q-Q plot, Scale-Location, and Residuals vs. Factor Levels. <br>

* Results: <br>
  Found that there was a significant Anesthesia effect and not a significant Dog effect on PE Concentration using Œ± = 0.05. It appeared that Cyclopropane has the highest PE Concentration and the largest variance while Isoflurane has the lowest mean and the smallest variance. The plots indicated the errors do not have a constant variance and deviations from the tails of the residuals distribution. <br>


#### [Cluster Analysis - Pharmaceutical Industry & Breakfast Cereals](https://github.com/LobbyRokie/cv/blob/gh-pages/Academic%20Projects/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Cluster%20Analysis%20-%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20%26%20Breakfast%20Cereals.pdf) _(2015)_ <br>
* The project involved hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance being used and the variables values being normalized to their respective z-scores. The Ward's method was chosen over complete linkage, single linkage, and centroid distance since it made the most distinct groups. 


#### [Quality Assurance and Lean Six Sigma - Mesa Products](https://github.com/LobbyRokie/cv/tree/gh-pages/Academic%20Projects/Quality%20Control%20Six%20Sigma%20Projects) _(2015)_ <br>
